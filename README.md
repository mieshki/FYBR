 Simple Web application for tracking your gpx files recorded during Bicycle rides. After uploading it will generate interactive map where you can choose type of road you had ridden.
 
 To start this project on your machine you have to run docker container with postgress database. We created docker-compose.yml file, so you only have to type command in terminal docker-compoose up -d.
 Next step you need to do is use our requiremts.txt with all needed stuff to run this app. Type pip -r requirements.txt in your terminal window.
 Configure yours interpreter for run.py and it will work.
